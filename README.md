# Thesis-Code

Jupyter notebooks containing the code used for the masters thesis "Autophagy in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae: single-cell and multi-cell model approaches".


**figures.ipynb**: the code used to create most of the plots. The rest of the plots can be found in fitting.ipynb.<br>
**fitting.ipynb**: the different fitting procedures with parameter bounds.<br>
**sensitivity.ipynb**: the code and results of the sensitivity analysis.<br>
**ode_sys.ipynb**: functions for all ODE systems and some of the plots. With the last cell, a corresponding .py file can be generated.
This file is then imported by the other notebooks.
